IOT BASED HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM. 
Nowadays People are facing a problem of unexpected death due to various illness which is because of lack of medical care to the patients at the right time. The primary goal was to develop a reliable patient monitoring system using IoT so that the healthcare professionals can monitor their patients, who are either hospitalized or at home using an IoT based integrated healthcare system. A mobile device based wireless healthcare monitoring system was developed which can provide real time online information about physiological conditions of a patient .
The patient’s temperature, heart beat rate are monitored, displayed and stored by the system and sent to the doctor’s mobile containing the application. Thus, IoT based patient monitoring system effectively monitor patient’s health statusand save life on time.
