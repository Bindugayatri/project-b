Iot based health monitoring system. 
Nowadays People are facing a problem of 
unexpected death due to various illness which is because of lack of medical care to the patients 
at right time. The primary goal was to develop a reliable patient monitoring system using IoT so 
that the healthcare professionals can monitor their patients, who are either hospitalized or at 
home using an IoT based integrated healthcare system. A mobile device based wireless healthcare monitoring system was developed 
which can provide real time online information about physiological conditions of a patient .
 The patient’s temperature, heart beat rate
are monitored, displayed and stored by the system and sent to the doctor’s mobile containing the 
application. Thus, IoT based patient monitoring system effectively monitor patient’s health status
and save life on time
